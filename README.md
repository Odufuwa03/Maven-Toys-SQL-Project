# Maven-Toys-SQL-Project
# Hello Everyone,
I’m excited to share my recent SQL project titled “Maven Toys Data Analysis”.
# Project Description:
This project uses SQL to analyze the dataset of a toy store.
The object of the project is to gain valuable insights into the store’s operation, products and location.
The goal of the project is to answer a set of questions about the store’s business performance and help in its growth by making better decisions.
The dataset contains 4 tables:
The Products table contains the 35 products sold at Maven Toys with fields containing details of the product id, product name, product category, product cost and product price.
The Sales table contains the units sold in over 800,000 sales transactions from January 2017 to October 2018 and the fields containing details of sale id, date, store id, product id and units.
The Stores table contains the 50 Maven Toys store location with fields containing details of the store id, store name, store city, store location and store open date.
The Inventory table contains over 1500 records that represent the stock on hand of each product in each store at the current point in time (Oct 1, 2018) and fields in the table are store id, product id and stock on hand
# Queries of the project:
Q1: Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store locations?

Q2: How much money is tied up in inventory at the toy stores? 

Q3: Most sale transactions (volume) by product category and location.

Q4: Top 10 most revenue stores

Q5: Bottom 10 least revenue stores
